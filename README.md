# Minimal

I've attempted to consistently limit myself to three primary colors to style similar semantic elements across languages, while remaining easy on the eyes.

- <span style='color:#e10'>Red</span>: is used for `constants` and `numeric values`
- <span style='color:#090'>Green</span>: is used for `strings` and `attributes`
- <span style='color:#00f'>Blue</span>: is used for `language` elements

Different shades and subtle color variants are used to create a visual hierarchy that's quick to read/scan.

**Note**: this theme is a _work in progress_ though actively maintained.

This theme is loosely based upon the `Mac Classic` theme from the _good-old_ Textmate days, but built from the ground up.

## Web development

I've created this theme purely for personal use and from personal experience. It is therefor optimised and actively maintained for the languages I regularly use: `html`, `php`, `coffee-/javascript`, `(s)css`, `mysql` and `markdown`.

Suggestions in general or for a better integration with other languages are highly appreciated.
