# Minimal

I've attempted to consistently limit myself to three primary colors to style similar semantic elements across languages, while remaining easy on the eyes.

- <span style='color:#e10'>**Red**</span>: is used for `constants` and `numeric values`
- <span style='color:#090'>**Green**</span>: is used for `strings` and `attributes`
- <span style='color:#00f'>**Blue**</span>: is used for `language` elements

Different shades and subtle color variants are used to create a visual hierarchy that's quick to read/scan.

## Web development

I've created this theme purely for personal use and from personal experience. It is therefor optimised and actively maintained for the languages I regularly use: `html`, `php`, `coffeescript`, `javascript`, `scss`, `css`, `mysql`, `apache` and `markdown`.

Suggestions in general or for a better integration with other languages are highly appreciated. This theme is still a _work in progress_ though **actively maintained**.
